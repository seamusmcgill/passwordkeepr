- thanks / intro spiel

Our group is presenting the app PasswordKeepR

Introduce ourselves
  - Barento
  - Andrew
  - Seamus

Maybe why we picked??

## STACK - ANDREW

Our app is built with jQuery, SASS and the Pico CSS framework on the front-end

On the back-end we used Express, PostgreSQL and NodeJS

We chose to build our app as a single-page application, sacrificing a bit of load time for a more seamless user experience for the rest of use

## DEMO - PASSWORDS TABLE - SEAMUS

start off the demo on the passwords table page with secure mode
  - a list of all an organizations passwords, hint that we'll demo another org after
  - information that gets displayed
  - copy in one click
  - search feature
  - Add category button and category filter feature

## DEMO - SECURE MODE - ANDREW

Our app features a secure mode where all the passwords are protected from prying eyes

When the mode is on, user requires a password to reveal any password

You can't edit passwords until it's turned off

To turn it off it requires password

## DEMO - EDIT + CREATE PASSWORDS - BARENTO

A logged in user can edit details about a password
  - username, password, description, and can reassign categories

Any user can create a password
  - enter all the info about the service / username
  - a user can generate a password given a few parameters they choose
    - includes special characters, uppercase, and length
  - password gets added to passwords table

## LESSONS LEARNED - SEAMUS

We learned a lot working together on this project

The level of communication and planning was an eye opener

Deciding on app structure was time consuming but helped understanding of the project

Remaining available during merges to fix any conflicts that might pop up

Dividing and conquering tasks

MVP - making sure to build the simplest version of something first, get it working, then add features onto it

Thank you!
